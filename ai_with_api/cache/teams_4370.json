      "strDescriptionEN": "Aston Martin Racing is a British auto racing team established in 2004 as a partnership between automobile manufacturer Aston Martin and engineering group Prodrive. The partnership was initially created for the purpose of returning Aston Martin to sports car racing with the DBR9, a heavily modified variant of the Aston Martin DB9. Since the DBR9's racing debut in 2005, Aston Martin Racing has expanded to build a variety of cars available to customers, as well as development of Aston Martin's V12 engine for Le Mans Prototype use. Aston Martin Racing's program has earned several successes over the years.\r\n\r\nAlthough all cars are built by Prodrive at their factory, Aston Martin plays an integral part in designing the race cars, as well as integrating elements of the race cars back into Aston Martin's road cars.\r\n\r\nOn 23 April 2009, Aston Martin chairman and Prodrive founder David Richards announced his intent to return to Formula One in 2010 with the possibility of using the Aston Martin name, however this never materialised. Aston Martin had previously raced in the 1959 and 1960 Formula One seasons but failed to score points in either year.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Alpine F1 Team, competing as BWT Alpine F1 Team, is a Formula One constructor which made its debut at the start of the 2021 Formula One World Championship. Formerly named Renault F1 Team and owned by the French automotive company Groupe Renault, the team was rebranded for 2021 to promote Renault's sports car brand, Alpine, and continues to serve as Renault's works team. The chassis and managerial side of the team is based in Enstone, Oxfordshire, England, and the engine side of the team is based in Viry-Ch\u00e2tillon, a suburb of Paris, France.",

      "strDescriptionFR": "Alpine F1 Team est une \u00e9curie de Formule 1, appartenant au constructeur automobile fran\u00e7ais Renault. Renault participe sous son nom au championnat du monde de Formule 1 en tant que constructeur de ch\u00e2ssis et motoriste de 1977 \u00e0 1985, de 2002 \u00e0 2011 et de 2016 \u00e0 2020. \u00c0 partir de 2021, l'\u00e9curie change de nom pour devenir Alpine F1 Team. Sur les p\u00e9riodes interm\u00e9diaires, Renault s'en est tenu au r\u00f4le de motoriste.\r\n\r\nRenault, qui d\u00e9bute en tant que constructeur en Formule 1 lors de la saison 1977, y introduit le moteur V6 turbocompress\u00e9. Les d\u00e9buts sont difficiles et les observateurs britanniques ne manquent pas de surnommer la monoplace fran\u00e7aise \u00ab la th\u00e9i\u00e8re jaune \u00bb. En 1979, Renault remporte sa premi\u00e8re victoire lors du Grand Prix de France avec Jean-Pierre Jabouille.\r\n\r\nLe turbocompresseur se g\u00e9n\u00e9ralise en Formule 1 au d\u00e9but des ann\u00e9es 1980 ; en 1981, Renault engage Alain Prost qui remporte neuf victoires, obtient dix pole positions et ne passe pas loin du titre mondial en 1983. Renault se retire du championnat \u00e0 la fin de la saison 1985 et conserve son r\u00f4le de motoriste, permettant dans les ann\u00e9es 1990 \u00e0 Williams de remporter cinq titres des constructeurs et \u00e0 Benetton de s'en adjuger un.\r\n\r\nLe groupe fran\u00e7ais revient en tant que constructeur de ch\u00e2ssis en 2002 apr\u00e8s le rachat de l'\u00e9curie Benetton Formula intervenu le 16 mars 2000. Il obtient deux titres mondiaux des constructeurs en 2005 et 2006 ainsi que deux titres de champion du monde des pilotes avec Fernando Alonso.\r\n\r\n\u00c0 partir de 2009, le fonds d'investissement Genii Capital devient actionnaire de l'\u00e9curie avec le rachat d'une partie des parts du constructeur automobile fran\u00e7ais Renault. Fin 2010, Genii Capital devient le propri\u00e9taire unique de l'\u00e9curie et la d\u00e9nomination commerciale de l'\u00e9curie est Lotus Renault GP. \u00c0 partir de 2012, Genii Capital produit ses propres ch\u00e2ssis et s'inscrit en championnat du monde sous la d\u00e9nomination Lotus F1 Team.\r\n\r\nRenault F1 Team, qui a quitt\u00e9 le championnat du monde des constructeurs, reprend son r\u00f4le de motoriste pour r\u00e9gner sur l'\u00e8re des V8 atmosph\u00e9riques avec Red Bull Racing (quatre titres mondiaux pilotes remport\u00e9s par Sebastian Vettel et constructeurs de 2010 \u00e0 2013) puis rach\u00e8te les parts de Genii Capital afin de revenir en 2016 en tant que constructeur sous la d\u00e9nomination Renault Sport Formula 1 Team, avec Cyril Abiteboul comme directeur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vasseur comme patron de la comp\u00e9tition, Kevin Magnussen et Jolyon Palmer comme pilotes.\r\n\r\nLe 11 janvier 2017, Renault annonce le d\u00e9part de Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vasseur, alors que Nico H\u00fclkenberg est engag\u00e9 aux c\u00f4t\u00e9s de Jolyon Palmer pour la saison 2017. Carlos Sainz Jr. remplace Jolyon Palmer, en manque de r\u00e9sultats, \u00e0 partir du Grand Prix des \u00c9tats-Unis et est confirm\u00e9 pour la saison 2018. Pour la saison 2019, Daniel Ricciardo s'engage avec Renault alors que Carlos Sainz Jr quitte l'\u00e9curie pour McLaren Racing. En 2020, Daniel Ricciardo conserve son baquet tandis que Nico H\u00fclkenberg est remplac\u00e9 par Esteban Ocon. Le pilote australien obtient au cours de ce championnat les deux premiers podiums de l'\u00e9curie depuis 2011, deux fois une troisi\u00e8me place, alors qu'Esteban Ocon r\u00e9ussit \u00e0 se classer deuxi\u00e8me lors de l'avant-derni\u00e8re course de la saison.\r\n\r\nPour 2021, Fernando Alonso fait son retour dans l'\u00e9curie avec laquelle il a obtenu ses deux titres de champion du monde (mais renomm\u00e9e Alpine F1 Team) pour remplacer Ricciardo parti chez McLaren, alors que Cyril Abiteboul quitte son poste de directeur de l'\u00e9curie pour \u00eatre remplac\u00e9 par Davide Brivio.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "McLaren Racing Limited, trading as McLaren Honda, is a British Formula One team based in Woking, Surrey, England, United Kingdom. McLaren is best known as a Formula One constructor but has also competed and won in the Indianapolis 500 and Canadian-American Challenge Cup (Can-Am). The team is the second oldest active team after Ferrari. They are one of the most successful teams in Formula One history, having won 182 races, 12 drivers' championships and 8 constructors' championships. The team is a wholly owned subsidiary of McLaren Group.\r\n\r\nFounded in 1963 by New Zealander Bruce McLaren, the team won its first Grand Prix at the 1968 Belgian Grand Prix but their greatest initial success was in Can-Am, where they dominated from 1967 to 1971. Further American triumph followed, with Indianapolis 500 wins in McLaren cars for Mark Donohue in 1972 and Johnny Rutherford in 1974 and 1976. After Bruce McLaren died in a testing accident in 1970, Teddy Mayer took over and led the team to their first Formula One constructors' championship in 1974, with Emerson Fittipaldi and James Hunt winning the drivers' championship in 1974 and 1976 respectively. 1974 also marked the start of a long standing sponsorship by Phillip Morris' Marlboro cigarette brand.\r\n\r\nIn 1981 McLaren merged with Ron Dennis' Project Four Racing; Dennis took over as team principal and shortly after organised a buyout of the original McLaren shareholders to take full control of the team. This began the team's most successful era: with Porsche and Honda engines, Niki Lauda, Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna took between them seven drivers' championships and McLaren six constructors' championships. The combination of Prost and Senna was particularly dominant\u2014together they won all but one race in 1988\u2014but later their rivalry soured and Prost left for Ferrari. Fellow English team Williams offered the most consistent challenge during this period, the two winning every constructors' title between 1984 and 1994. However, by the mid-1990s Honda had withdrawn from Formula One, Senna had moved to Williams and the team went three seasons without a win. With Mercedes-Benz engines, West sponsorship and former Williams designer Adrian Newey, further championships came in 1998 and 1999 with driver Mika H\u00e4kkinen and during the 2000s the team were consistent front-runners, driver Lewis Hamilton taking their latest title in 2008. In 2009 Dennis retired as team principal of McLaren handing the former role to longtime McLaren employee Martin Whitmarsh. At the end of 2013, after the team's worst season since 2004, Whitmarsh was ousted. In October 2014, Sam Michael, would be quitting his role at McLaren Racing. In 2013, McLaren announced they would be using Honda engines from 2015 onwards, replacing Mercedes-Benz.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Mercedes-Benz is currently involved in Formula One, running the Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team, a Formula One racing team, based in Brackley, United Kingdom, using a German licence. Mercedes-Benz had competed in the pre-war European Championship winning three titles, and debuted in Formula One in 1954, running a team for two years.\r\n\r\nAfter winning their first race at the 1954 French Grand Prix, driver Juan Manuel Fangio won another three grands prix to win the 1954 drivers championship, and repeated this success in 1955 when he won the second title for Mercedes-Benz. Despite winning two championships, Mercedes-Benz withdrew from motor racing in response to the 1955 Le Mans disaster, and did not return until rejoining as an engine supplier in association with Ilmor in 1994.\r\n\r\nMercedes-Benz returned as an engine supplier in 1994 in a partnership with Ilmor, now called Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains. It supplied Sauber for one season, then switched to McLaren in 1995. In 2009 they also became suppliers of Brawn GP and Force India. Mercedes-Benz returned with a factory team in 2010 after the purchase of Brawn. A fourth team was added to the supplying program in 2014, Williams.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer has collected more than 100 wins as engine supplier, and is ranked fourth in Formula One history. Two constructors and four drivers championships have been won with Mercedes-Benz engines.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Ferrari S.p.A. is an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer based in Maranello. Founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1929, as Scuderia Ferrari, the company sponsored drivers and manufactured race cars before moving into production of street-legal vehicles as Ferrari S.p.A. in 1947. Fiat acquired 50% of Ferrari in 1969 and expanded its stake to 85% in 2008. In 2014 Fiat announced its intentions to sell its share in Ferrari, as of the announcement Fiat owned 90% of Ferrari. Throughout its history, the company has been noted for its continued participation in racing, especially in Formula One, where it has had great success. Ferrari road cars are generally seen as a symbol of speed, luxury and wealth.\r\nEnzo Ferrari was not initially interested in the idea of producing road cars when he formed Scuderia Ferrari (literally \"Ferrari Stable\", and usually used to mean \"Team Ferrari\", it is correctly pronounced ) in 1928 as a sponsor for amateur drivers headquartered in Modena. Ferrari prepared, and successfully raced, various drivers in Alfa Romeo cars until 1938, when he was hired by Alfa Romeo to head their motor racing department.\r\n\r\nIn 1941, Alfa Romeo was confiscated by the fascist government of Benito Mussolini as part of the Axis Powers' war effort. Enzo Ferrari's division was small enough to be unaffected by this. Because he was prohibited by contract from racing for four years, the Scuderia briefly became Auto Avio Costruzioni Ferrari, which ostensibly produced machine tools and aircraft accessories. Also known as SEFAC (Scuderia Enzo Ferrari Auto Corse), Ferrari did in fact produce one race car, the Tipo 815, in the non-competition period. It was the first actual Ferrari car (it debuted at the 1940 Mille Miglia), but due to World War II it saw little competition. In 1943 the Ferrari factory moved to Maranello, where it has remained ever since. The factory was bombed by the Allies in 1944 and rebuilt in 1946, after the war ended, and included a works for road car production.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Italian motor manufacturer Alfa Romeo has participated many times in Formula One. It currently participates as Alfa Romeo Racing while being operated by Sauber Motorsport AG. The brand has competed in motor racing as both a constructor and engine supplier sporadically between 1950 and 1987, and later as a commercial partner since 2015. The company's works drivers won the first two World Drivers' Championships in the pre-war Alfetta: Nino Farina in 1950; and Juan Manuel Fangio in 1951. Following these successes Alfa Romeo withdrew from Formula One.\r\n\r\nDuring the 1960s, although the company had no official presence in the top tier of motorsport a number of Formula One teams used independently developed Alfa Romeo engines to power their cars. In the early 1970s, Alfa provided Formula One support for their works driver Andrea de Adamich, supplying adapted versions of their 3-litre V8 engine from the Alfa Romeo Tipo 33/3 sports car to power Adamich's McLaren (1970) and March (1971) entries. None of these engine combinations scored championship points.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-1970s, Alfa engineer Carlo Chiti designed a flat-12 engine to replace the T33 V8, which achieved some success in taking the 1975 World Sportscar Championship. Bernie Ecclestone, then owner of the Brabham Formula One team, persuaded Alfa Romeo to supply this engine free for the 1976 Formula One season. Although the Brabham-Alfa Romeo's first season was relatively modest, during the 1977 and 1978 World Championships their cars took 14 podium finishes, including two race victories for Niki Lauda.\r\n\r\nThe company's sporting department, Autodelta, returned as the works team in 1979. This second period as a constructor was less successful than the first. Between the company's return and its withdrawal as a constructor at the end of 1985, Alfa works drivers did not win a race and the team never finished higher than sixth in the World Constructors' Championship. The team's engines were also supplied to Osella from 1983 to 1987, but they scored only two World Championship points during this period.\r\n\r\nThe Alfa Romeo logo returned to Formula One in 2015, appearing on the Scuderia Ferrari cars. In late 2017, Alfa Romeo announced that they were to become title sponsors for Sauber from 2018, and had entered into a technical and commercial partnership with the team. Alfa Romeo returned to the sport as their own team when Sauber was renamed at the beginning of 2019.",

      "strDescriptionEN": "Williams Grand Prix Engineering Limited, currently racing in Formula One as ROKiT Williams Racing, is a British Formula One motor racing team and constructor. It was founded by team owner Sir Frank Williams and automotive engineer Sir Patrick Head. It is still run by Williams. The team was formed in 1977 after Frank Williams's two earlier unsuccessful F1 operations: Frank Williams Racing Cars (1969 to 1975) and Wolf\u2013Williams Racing (1976). All of Williams F1 chassis are called \"FW\" then a number, the FW being the initials of team owner, Frank Williams. \r\n\r\nWilliams's first race was the 1977 Spanish Grand Prix, where the new team ran a March chassis for Patrick N\u00e8ve. Williams started manufacturing its own cars the following year, and Switzerland's Clay Regazzoni won Williams's first race at the 1979 British Grand Prix. At the 1997 British Grand Prix, Canadian Jacques Villeneuve scored the team's 100th race victory, making Williams one of only three teams in Formula One, alongside Ferrari and fellow British team McLaren, to win 100 races. Williams won nine Constructors' Championships between 1980 and 1997. This stood as a record until Ferrari surpassed it in 2000.\r\n\r\nMany famous racing drivers have driven for Williams, including Australia's Alan Jones; Finland's Keke Rosberg; Britain's Nigel Mansell, Damon Hill and Jenson Button; France's Alain Prost; Brazil's Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna, and Canada's Jacques Villeneuve, each of whom, with the exception of Senna and Button, have captured one drivers' title with the team. Interestingly, of those who have won the championship with Williams, only Jones, Rosberg and Villeneuve actually defended their title while still with the team. Piquet moved to Lotus after winning the 1987 championship, Mansell moved to the American based Indy Cars after winning the 1992 championship, Prost retired from racing after his 4th World Championship in 1993, while Hill moved to Arrows after winning in 1996.\r\n\r\nWilliams have worked with many notable engine manufacturers, most successfully with Renault: Williams won five of their nine constructors' titles with the French company. Along with Ferrari, McLaren, Benetton and Renault, Williams is one of a group of five teams that won every Constructors' Championship between 1979 and 2008 and every Drivers' Championship from 1984 to 2008.\r\n\r\nWilliams F1 also has business interests beyond Formula One racing. It has established Williams Advanced Engineering and Williams Hybrid Power which take technology originally developed for Formula One and adapt it for commercial applications. In April 2014, Williams Hybrid Power were sold to GKN. Williams Advanced Engineering had a technology centre in Qatar until it was closed in 2014.",
